## Overall Idea: Workout Tracker
Design a website [and an Android app later] that allows users to input daily workout habits.
Potential follow-up: Spending Tracker[Personal income and expenditure records]. 

## Technical stack: 
1. Front-End: Simple UI -> react.js
2. Back-End: Java + Springboot
3. Middle: REST-API
4. Android Related

## Program Logic
Need more details in future. 

## What we need to learn:
- Database
- RESTful API
- Java
- SpringBoot
- Android related...
- Remote server (aws)
- Domain hosting

## Milestones: 
1) Basic Learning (long-term)
2) Program logic + database development
3) Design middleware + basic frontend
4) deploy on remote server & integration test
5) improve frontend
6) mobile development 

## Workflow[Agile]
- Overall:
  1. Create an issue for the feature/bug.
  2. Create(branch out) a feature/bugFix branch from `Prod`(production/develop) branch. The branch name should be `Issue number Issue Name`. For example, `2-Create-Design-Document`. 
  3. Working on the task.
  4. After completing the programming task, create a PR for the issue.
  5. Other team members will review and comment on the PR.
  6. Refine code based on the reviews and comments.
  7. After the PR is approved by at least 2 team members, the PR will be merged.

## Code Quality Requirements
Since this is a practicing project, please write as many comments as you can for the code. Comments should include program logic and the framework/tool you used. 
Please also make sure an entry-level learner should be able to learn the project with the help of the comments.
