## 1. Branching Strategy
   - `main` branch is the most important branch, and it is also our production branch. For every time we finish a milestone, merge develop branch into main as a rerlease. 
   - `develop` branch is out main develop branch. Typically, all feature branch should merge into develop branch after the job is finished. 
   - When creating a feature branch, you shoud name your feature branch in this way: Issue#-Issue-title. For example, `9-Create-Workflow-Manual`. 
   - If the issue is a long-term issue, that is, the issue may be repeatedly opened and closed. In this case, the branch naming needs to include a suffix number.For example, `3-Review-Design-Document-1`, `3-Review-Design-Document-2`...
   - After merge, the feature branch should be deleted. 

## 2. Code Standards
   - TBD

## 3. Issue Standards
   - A clear and simple title.
   - Write some descriptional words for introduction.

## 4. PR Standards
   - Explain what you did. 
   - Correct branch naming. 
   - Mention the issue page on the PR page. 
   - After at least two other developers have approved the PR, the author of PR will proceed with the merge.

## 5. Workflow
   - Typical development workflow:
     - Find a problem/bug/possible improvement
     - Raise an issue for the problem/bug/possible improvement and discuss it with other developers
     - Pulling the latest changes from the develop branch.
     - Creating feature or bug-fix branches.
     - Committing changes and writing meaningful commit messages.
     - Pushing branches to GitHub.
     - Creating pull requests (PRs) for code review.
     - Addressing feedback and making necessary changes.
     - Merging PRs to the main branch.
     - Handling merge conflicts.

## 6 Code Reviews
   - TBD

## 7. Testing
   - TBD

## 8. Deployment
   - TBD

## 9. Collaboration and Communication
   - Try to discuss on github first. 
   - If github discussion cannot work, make a 1 on 1 zoom meeting. 
   - If 1 on 1 zoom meeting cannot solve the disagreements, talk about it on weekly all developer meeting.  
   - Never discuss any technical issue in WeChat!

## 10. Security and Data Protection
   - TBD

## 11. Documentation
   - TBD

## 12. Team Resources
   - Ask Runpeng Nie for more details.
